Querying through GUI to execute complex as well as simple queries has proved to be an efficient system to people who do not have much knowledge about databases.
The Graphical User Interface generates the queries using Mysql as the database.
This use of databases to generate the queries can be successfully implemented so that the work of writing full queries can be reduced and a non-technical user can also use it without having any knowledge of databases

    Following features of  MYSQL will be covered in making the software i.e.
           1. Create Table
           2. Alter Table
           3. Drop Table
           4. View Data (Basic Select Queries)
           5. View Table Structure
           6. Insert / Update / Delete Data
           7. Create Views
           8. Drop Views
           9. Display Data through Views
